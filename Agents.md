- Commands need to be idempotent
- Don't reinstall things already installed
- Do everything via scripts and do not install manually
- Only create in the repo and then stow.
- All of the content should be automatically installed when calling bootstrap.sh at the beginning of a setup.
- Installations should always come from the install-packages entry point. There can be multiple installation scripts but only one entry point.
- Use fedora COPR repository where dnf not available.
